# howfast

A simple Angular app that shows users how many countries' national records they are faster than.

e.g., entering a time of 15:40 for the 5,000 meters returns "you are faster than the runners of 20 countries..." and lists them.

All data was taken from Wikipedia and is current as of January 26, 2016.

<b>Directions for future development</b>
-Make it more pretty
-Add ability for the app to regularly update itself with most current data from Wikipedia
-Add D3.js to show a map highlighting all the countries the user is faster than
